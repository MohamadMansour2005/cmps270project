Three Musketeers’ Battleship Project
This project is an advanced and upgraded version of the popular game “Battleship”. It allows a human player to play against a Bot that we created. 
We made this project for a class assignment and to improve our coding and software construction skills.
The game ends when one of the player’s four ships get destroyed. The ships of each player will be placed at the beginning of the game in a 10x10 grid, where ships are placed vertically or horizontally depending on the player’s preferences or strategies. 
Each player has 1 carrier (occupies 5 cells), 1 battleship (4 cells), 1 destroyer (3 cells) and 1 submarine (2 cells).
The game features new gameplay mechanics such as radar sweeps (reveals a 2x2 area of the opponent’s grid), smoke screens (blocks radar sweeps in a 2x2 area), artillery attacks (attacks a 2x2 area), and torpedoes attack (attacks an entire row or column).
The bot operates as a player, where it places its ships strategically and conducts attacks based on memory and favorable results.
The project was coded using the language C. To be able to run it, the user needs to have access to a C compiler.
The project's code is filled with comments securing an easy navigation throughout its contents.
